# OpenGL library function samples

### In this repository, there are samples of many functions of the OpenGL library. These samples were generally made about the following topics:
* Per-Fragment Operations
* Special Functions
* Whole Framebuffer Operations
* State and State Requests
* Framebuffer Objects

### You will encounter many examples that will enable you to easily understand the functions visually, you can easily compile and view the cpp files with the existing build files.
#### You can easily build by entering the commands shown in the example below into your terminal:

```python
git clone https://github.com/AysegulTerzi/OpenGL-functions.git
cd path/to/OpenGL-functions
cd depthMask
./build.sh
./depthmask

```
#### When you run these commands, you should display the following window:
